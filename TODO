Ideas to do Today:
  [x] Add exit and enter methods to the menu, game and settings menu classes. @low @10m
  [x] 8 directional player movement. @30m @today
  [] Have this movement be incorporated with delta time. @high @30m
Ideas for Later:
  [] Menu with options for resizing a window? @low
  [] Make the scene manger its own file. @high 
  [] Restructure project, (make scene manager its own file and the base class its own file, module?)
